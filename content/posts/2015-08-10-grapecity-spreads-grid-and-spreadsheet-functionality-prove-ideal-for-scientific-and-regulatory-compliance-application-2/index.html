<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Promega® Corporation offers Molecular Biology, DNA-based human identification, DNA purification, Clinical Diagnostic Research, and Drug Discovery products to life scientists worldwide.� The R&amp;D and manufacture of most of their products involve computer programs that interface scientific instruments to collect and then manage vast amounts of data. Louis M. Mezei, Promega&#8217;s Sr. Scientific Fellow, is the primary programmer responsible for creating these applications. Mr. Mezei has found Spread to be the ideal solution for gathering, displaying, archiving, and summarizing data for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connectivity to SQL Server, SharePoint, web services, and SAP is easy with Spread because it uses Visual Studio .NET programming tools and you can easily code your own connections with C#.</li>
<li>Non-programming subject matter experts (scientists) can help create data templates by designing them in Microsoft Excel, which can then be compiled as objects into Resource files, and in turn be quickly streamed into the Spread container.</li>
<li>The ability to programmatically modify the formulae and charts in Spread on the fly to customize templates.</li>
<li>Since Spread-based applications are compiled, the templates and underlying logic and code can&#8217;t be tampered with, making regulatory and ISO compliance worry free.</li>
<li>Since Spread can be embedded into a Windows Form, it makes it so you don’t even need to have Excel installed on a lab computer … which saves money on Office Microsoft Licensing and Maintenance fees, as well as not having to deal with Interop (which is always a mess in .NET because of versioning issues) and not having to deal with a user ‘killing off’ Excel in the middle of a run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Mezei has been able to easily create a large portfolio of applications by reusing two parts of a custom user control that he created: � A .NET SplitContainer comprised of a Spread component and a ToolBar that he created.</p>
<p>He also wrote a reusable class library (DLL) to handle data transactions to/from cells as well as to manipulate the cells and charts in templates on the fly.</p>
<p>With this model, creating new applications became just a matter of dragging and dropping the Spread/ToolBar User Control onto a form and writing a few lines of code. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread calculates and summarizes data received from various scientific instruments.� For example, one of his applications processes in excess of 35,000,000 transactions per year between the application and scientific instruments.</li>
<li>One of his applications has saved Promega over $400,000 by automating complicated calculations and the design of follow-up experiments.</li>
<li>One application catalogs a library of live cell samples to give scientists a real-time inventory view.</li>
<li>An Electronic Laboratory Notebook system manages and provides search results of over 18,000 scientific notebooks stored in SharePoint.</li>
<li>A supply management application uses Spread forms to manage the ordering, manufacturing, QA, and delivery of oligonucleotide primers, which are then used in Promega’s Genetic Identity (GI) and PCR products.</li>
<li>National law enforcement organizations utilize results of a Spread-based application that searches Promega’s GI database to formally rule out workers involved in the manufacturing process as potential suspects at a crime scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these solutions and many more were created and based on Spread&#8217;s ability to stream Excel resource objects into its container, which made application development very fast. � That is, non-programmer subject matter experts created data views in Excel. � Mezei would then simply compile and stream Excel file resource objects into Spread as templates, wire up the data and toolbars, and build the application.</p>
<p>Mezei has been a loyal user of Spread for many years and the investment has paid off. He is able to create applications (and prototypes) quickly, Promega&#8217;s users are able to process data efficiently, errors are reduced, and regulatory compliance is easy.� Mr. Mezei himself concluded, &#8220;I have been doing direct instrument control and dumping data into spreadsheets since Lotus, actually won an award in December, 1990 from Lotus Magazine for tying the two together, and was a Prentice Hall bestselling author of computer books for scientists and engineers in the 1980’s.� But I have to tell you that Spread takes it to a quantum leap level.� It really solves all of those nasty issues with Excel that everyone knows about, but doesn’t do anything about.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Full Case Study</strong></p>
<p>Promega is a leading service and technology provider in the Human Identification, Molecular Biology, and Clinical Diagnostics industries, so Louis Mezei and his colleagues are responsible for processing vast amounts of data from disparate sources that include scientific instruments, SQL Server, SharePoint, SAP, remote processing servers, and web services.� The ease of connecting all of these sources together into a closed, bulletproof system was the first thing that interested him in Spread&#8217;s .NET component. Spread’s ability to be programmed by C# is important because C# provides connectivity to standard data sources such as SQL Server and SharePoint and that is what interested him initially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those connectivity interactions are either very messy or impossible with Excel,&#8221; Mezei commented. &#8220;Bottom line is that by having an ‘embedded Excel-like’ component you can easily and robustly do all of those messy things, you can make it look and feel like the familiar Excel to the scientists, and more importantly, you can do it with a ‘real’ programming language, like C# or C++, instead of relying on VBA and kluging things together is what really attracted me to looking into Spread. The integration between Spread and our data services is amazing, seamless, and totally bullet proof, and I can do it all with one programming language.� Long term storage and retrieval of massive amounts of records is crucially important to our business.� So, this is really important to me as a programmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second reason Mr. Mezei chose to use Spread is because of its compatibility with Microsoft Excel. That compatibility allows the scientists themselves to use something they are familiar with to create their own templates which Louis can then stream into Spread at run time.� Although Mezei is a scientist, this ability removes any need to transfer knowledge between how a specific subject matter expert would like to see their results formatted and the programmer, saving time and reducing the need for revision cycles.� It also makes prototyping very fast.� &#8220;I can’t tell you how convenient it is for my ‘specifications guy’ to be able to work with scientists to design a rough draft of the template they need in Excel and then for me to be able to tweak and compile it quickly and directly as a resource object and make a prototype. They look at it.� I tweak it again.� They approve it.� At that point, all I have to do is add code to move data.� They check it. � I am done.&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>The third and perhaps most important reason Louis uses Spread is for regulatory compliance. Since Promega&#8217;s software serves the life sciences industry, it is critical that they comply with regulations from organizations such as the FDA and ISO. At run time, the Spread application is a self-contained, compiled .NET program.� So Spread, the template resource, the code used for business rules, and data management cannot be accessed and tampered with by end users. If he were using Excel, that would not be the case.</p>
<p>Spread is a full-featured component that works right out of the box. All you need to do is drag and drop it onto a form or user control and it is ready to use. This empowered Mr. Mezei to take it a step further by building his applications based on a single, custom user control which he built as a standard .NET split container:� One area contains a tab strip and the other contains Spread.� A class library he wrote, “xlToolz”, handles all of the logic and the cell and chart manipulations. Those three things are all he needs to churn out an impressive portfolio of applications in an amazingly small amount of time.</p>
<p>Mr. Mezei&#8217;s applications are used by scientists, law enforcement agencies, and Promega&#8217;s own teams worldwide.� For example, he has versions for Promega’s facility in Shanghai that displays text in Chinese characters. � Below are some examples of how Promega uses Spread.</p>
<p>Non-professionals use ProdMonitor to capture weight (volume), torque, and burst data from robotically dispensed product.� It is important to continually monitor the process in real time and ‘tweak’ the robotic equipment to maintain their settings within narrow limits throughout the entire manufacturing process.� This program alone handles in excess of 35 million transactions per year.� It is powerful, fast, and takes almost no training to use.� Best of all, because all of the data and formulae are locked down, their QA department can be assured that the data have not been tampered with, calculations have not been changed, etc. and they can then confidently use Spread to show regulatory inspectors the SQLServer-stored data, which can been retrieved very quickly, as opposed to having to try to hunt through literally tens of thousands of paper-based batch binders.<figure id="attachment_664262" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>Like ProdMonitor, ProCell also has SQLServer connectivity. ProCell controls all of Promega&#8217;s mammalian cell lines, which are very expensive, die easily, and come with a great many legal restrictions.� Storage is the main issue.� Just locating a cell line in a farm of very cold freezers (liquid nitrogen, -80C) would be a huge undertaking without ProCell.� Just as importantly, it allows everyone in the company to know what they have on hand. The screen shot below illustrates many features. The context menu was created using Mezei&#8217;s own library mentioned earlier, the red boxes represent sticky notes, columns are sortable and filterable, cell values are selected from ComboBoxes (filled from SQLServer), and dates are input using a calendar control.� The right click context menu illustrates how to achieve cell-, column-, or row-specific functionality.<figure id="attachment_664267" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>ProSMART is a program that captures 96 microtiter plate data from a scientific instrument and calculates it.� Note that the curves are “S” shaped, meaning that they require non-linear curve fits.� Having the control built into the Windows Form allows easy calculation of the “S” shaped curves using a set of programmatically complicated functions in a C#/C++ DLL.<figure id="attachment_664268" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>ProPlex is a program that solved the issue of mere mortal scientists having to design experiments to optimize complex mixtures of biological products and saves Promega over $400,000 per year in these efforts.� ProPlex is a predictive “smart / expert system” program that creates a sequence of suggested next experiments (based on the current and previous ones) and which quickly normalizes sets of 32 different oligonucleotide primers, Internal Lane Standards, allelic ladders, Real Time PCR primer sets, etc, so that they give a perfectly normalized and consistent response during detection.� What used to take more than 50 experiments now takes just a couple.<figure id="attachment_664269" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>
<p><a href="http://sphelp.grapecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ProPlex1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-664269" alt="ProPlex saves $400,000 per year by automating experimental design" src="http://sphelp.grapecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ProPlex1-300x179.jpg" width="300" height="179" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ProPlex saves $400,000 per year by automating experimental design</figcaption></figure> </p>
<p>PAS.Net uses a set of templates that were originally developed and used in Excel. � PAS.Net controls ten different types of RS232-based and USB-based spectrophotometers, plate readers, and luminometers and supports about 90 different assays.� The number of templates can be minimized because there are groups of ‘sister’ assays that can share common base templates. The templates’ charts and calculations are modified on demand at run time when a user selects an assay by using the ‘xlToolz’ DLL methods mentioned above. This program can also access SharePoint data stores for data archiving, searching, and retrieving files in either pdf or Excel formats.<figure id="attachment_664270" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OligoNet is a program that manages the ordering, manufacture, QA, and inventorying of oligonucleotide syntheses.� The images below illustrate a Windows form that actually controls an oligonucleotide synthesizer, overlaid with a Windows form that does spectral analysis of the product.<figure id="attachment_664271" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>ProBook is an Electronic Laboratory NoteBook system (ELN).� The screen shot is a dump from a search of over 18,000 electronic notebooks for “Taq” (a thermostable enzyme that is the engine for PCR), which are stored in SharePoint.� This search took less than a second.� That same search would take overnight if it was disk file based, illustrating the crucial role of the connectivity to SharePoint.� Note the filters in the column headers.� They are very powerful for this kind of application because you can further refine and tweak searches without losing the existing one.� Column sorting is also very useful for organizing search results, as is the context menu for displaying content.<figure id="attachment_664273" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>
<p><a href="http://sphelp.grapecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ProBook.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-664273" alt="ProBook uses Spread to manage search results from 18,000 notebooks stored on SharePoint" src="http://sphelp.grapecity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ProBook-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ProBook uses Spread to manage search results from 18,000 notebooks stored on SharePoint</figcaption></figure> </p>
<p>Mr. Mezei has also developed Spread-based add-ins for Microsoft Office.� These add-ins allow scientists to be able to upload, search, and download ELN content from SharePoint right from within the Office program as they are designing and documenting their experiments.</p>
<p>There are many other Spread-based applications.� For example: � An application that manages and records the stability testing of Promega&#8217;s biological products (a very important FDA and ISO inspected set of data) and a pipette calibration program that has direct ties to SAP.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Louis Mezei has been a loyal user of Spread for many years and the investment has paid off. � He is able to create prototypes and applications quickly and cost effectively. � Promega&#8217;s users are able to process data efficiently, errors are reduced, and regulatory compliance is easy.� Mr. Mezei himself concluded, &#8220;I have been doing direct instrument control and dumping into spreadsheets since Lotus in the mid-1980’s and actually won an award in Dec, 1990 from Lotus Magazine for tying the two together.� But I have to tell you that Spread takes it to a quantum leap level.&#8221;</p>
