<p>Starting with the release of Spread Studio 8 SP1, SpreadJS is part of the Spread family. SpreadJS was originally part of Wijmo Enterprise (a GrapeCity JavaScript control library), so some of you reading this came from the Wijmo comunity and some are alreay familiar with the Spread product line. In either case, you probably have some questions about how SpreadJS is licensed and what your options are.</p>
<h2 id="general-details">General Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>SpreadJS is available by itself or as part of SpreadStudio. If you buy Spread Studio, you are licensed to use SpreadJS.</li>
<li>If you own Spread Studio 8, your license is good for SpreadJS. Your current key will work with it.</li>
<li>If your SpreadJS sheets have a watermark, you have the trial library. Please contact us to get the licensed version.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="for-wijmo-enterprise-users">For Wijmo Enterprise Users</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">We are granting a new SpreadJS stand-alone license to all Wijmo Enterprise users. If you have not received an email with a new key, please let us know.� </span></li>
<li>Our maintenance plan and support options have changed. SpreadJS’s base license includes minor releases and free online support. There is an optional yearly maintenance plan that entitles you to phone support and major releases. Wijmo Enterprise Platinum customers will automatically receive SpreadJS maintenance plans.</li>
<li>Starting with Wijmo Enterprise 2015 v2, SpreadJS will no longer be part of Wijmo Enterprise.</li>
<li>If you would like to upgrade to Spread Studio, please contact us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x73;&#x70;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#100;&#46;&#x73;&#97;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x73;&#x40;&#x67;&#114;&#97;&#112;&#x65;&#99;&#105;&#x74;&#121;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x73;&#x70;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#100;&#46;&#x73;&#97;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x73;&#x40;&#x67;&#114;&#97;&#112;&#x65;&#99;&#105;&#x74;&#121;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>.</li>
